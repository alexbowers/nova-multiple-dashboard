You can now add multiple custom dashboards in Laravel Nova.

Whether you want to group some cards together, have different dashboards visible depending on the logged in user, or want to provide a dashboard with your tool, Multiple Dashboards allows you to do this.

# Deprecated

This is now covered in Nova 2.1.0+ so does not need a package for it.

See [documentation](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/2.0/customization/dashboards.html#overview)

## Installation

You can install the package in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require alexbowers/nova-multiple-dashboard
```

## Usage

There is now a `php artisan nova:dashboard <name>` command exposed via the CLI.

If you run this, you'll get a `App/Nova/Dashboards` directory created, which will house your custom dashboards.

Dashboards have a `public $order` variable you can use to set the order they appear in the navbar. See the `Dashboard` class for more.

If you are another package creating a nova dashboard, you will need to register it using:

```php
\AlexBowers\MultipleDashboard\DashboardNova::registerDashboards(new \Your\Dashboard\Here);
```

You can register multiple at once by passing through to the `DashboardNova::registerDashboards` function.
